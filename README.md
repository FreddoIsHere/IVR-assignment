# IVR-assignment
Prints target estimation and true target porsition to terminal. Target is apparently not present at the start of simulator. That is why it is printed in iteration 100. At iteration 400 joint angles are printed. Joint angles can be a little inaccurate because it still wiggles at iteration 400, improvements are needed: end effector/4th angle is not the right one in some cases.
