Reacher.py is our new Reacher file, inside it on line 51 there is a boolean. It is set to true by
default, so will automatically use the obstacle avoidance mode. To turn this off set it to False,
and then it will behave like the default Reacher. 

When the end effector is not in the radius of influence of any obstacle, the closest obstacle
is marked with a white dot. When it is in the radius of any obstacle, a white dot will begin
to flash on the obstacle. Both of these help to understand where the obstacles are relative
to the end effector.

Due to the size of the space and sparcity of obstacles, it can take a while for the end effector 
to be in the radius of influence of an obstacle, meaning it takes a while to see the obstacle 
avoidance system in action. To overcome this we added the charge obstacle mode. On line 526 of 
Torque_ex.py, self.charge_obstacle is set to False by default, in which case the arm behaves 
like the normal trying to reach the target. When this is set to True, the arm will try to make 
the end effector touch the nearest obstacle, quickly displaying our obstacle avoidance system in action.
